You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.\\n\\n\\n## Basic tagging\\n\\nWhen you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with `News` and other posts with `Cycling`, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on `/tag/news/` and `/tag/cycling/`, respectively.\\n\\nIf you tag a post with both `News` *and* `Cycling` - then it appears in both sections.\\n\\nTag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have.

In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.\\n\\nFor example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.\\n\\n==**News**, Cycling, #video==\\n\\nHere, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of `News`, and `Cycling` - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with `#video`.\\n\\nIn your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting:\\n\\n```\\n{{#post}}\\n    {{#has tag=\\\"#video\\\"}}\\n        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...\\n    {{else}}\\n        ...regular markup for a post...\\n    {{/has}}\\n{{/post}}\\n```\\n\\nYou can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive [theme documentation](https://themes.ghost.org/).\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Ghost has a single, powerful organisational taxonomy, called tags.</p>\n<p>It doesn't matter whether you want to call them categories, tags, boxes, or anything else.

In her article \"Suicide on\nCampus and the Pressure of Perfection\n[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/education/edlife/stress-social-media-and-suicide-on-campus.html]\n,\" Julie Scelfo writes, \"America’s culture of hyperachievement among the\naffluent has been under scrutiny for at least the last decade... it robs\nchildren of opportunities to develop independence and resiliency, thereby\ncrippling them emotionally later in life.\" Michelle Gillman shares a similar\nsentiment in \"In the Name of College! What Are We Doing to Our Children?\n[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michelle-gilman/in-the-name-of-college-wh_b_6912914.html]\n\", \"Childhood is for learning about relationships, the outdoors, and sometimes\nbreaking the rules so we can learn our own edges and boundaries. This precious,\ninnocent time holds so much limitless potential - unless of course we squash it.\nAnd we have.\"\n\nThis precious, innocent time holds so much limitless potential - unless of\ncourse we squash it. And we have.\n\nDon't get me wrong, as a student myself, I most definitely do not approve of\nthis meaningless rush for college and employment. I have always touted\n(sometimes a tad ostentatiously) my focus on passion, how my success and my\ncourse choices are a natural extension of my love for computer science and\nphilanthropic work. Yet, it begs the question: If standards are becoming\nimpossibly high today, what chance do regular, oblivious students stand? The\nanswer could not be more deeply saddening.\n\nNetworking is Key\nI'll be honest, I have been extraordinarily lucky in having both found and been\nable to afford opportunities that most students do not get. Take SHAD, a program\nwhere some of the brightest high school students from across Canada are placed\nfor a month at university to learn and innovate. Short of the daily lectures and\nlaundry lessons I got from living on my own, SHAD gave me both an internship at\na large Canadian bank and access to an expansive network of incredibly smart,\npassionate, and successful people. So, on one hand, I have friends at school\ntelling me of their 80 or sometimes 90 percent marks, while, on the other hand,\nI have friends who are going to international competitions and shrugging off\nadmissions to some of the best universities out there.\n\nI have friends making 80 percent on one side and friends making international\nnews on the other.\n\nSo we beat on, pens against the test paper, borne back ceaselessly into the past\nIt's almost funny how much our current state of education mirrors that of\nFitzgerald's world. You have those who'll never succeed (Valley of Ashes), those\nwho are often oblivious to reality (Daisy), those who forge ahead with blind\nambition (Tom), those who fail to grapple with reality (Gatsby), and those who\nsit back and allow themselves to become bewildered by the insanity (Nick).\n\nSwept up by a torrent of both perfectionists and passionates, the pressure is on\nfor the rest of us to be perfect too. Trust me, I don't enjoy factoring \"mark\noutcome\" into my course selections - and I'm pretty sure most students don't\neither - but it has become a necessity if we as students ever want to do\nsomething cool with our lives. Who's to blame? I don't know. Certainly not the\npassionates, who (like me) have worked their way to where they are now for a\ncause. Nor the perfectionists, who have been taught from childhood that being\nperfect in life is the only way in life. It's a self-feeding process that some\nof us like to call a \"vicious circle.\" University and college should be about\nlearning and discovery - not about getting that $70k/yr first job. Yet, this is\nwhat it has come to.\n\n\"Can't repeat the past? Why, of course you can!\" said Gatsby.\n\nOh, a man can dream.","feature_image":"https://static.kevinpei.com/2016/1212314454_949835941763594_8762783606146965056_o_2-1482723041470.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","created_at":"2016-01-30 19:25:21","created_by":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","updated_at":"2016-12-26 03:30:49","updated_by":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","published_at":"2016-02-02 15:09:32","published_by":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null},{"id":"5a38742c2b00963fe766d278","uuid":"b2dbf333-a847-4097-96df-b93632573635","title":"Why MLH Prizes are (mostly) irrelevant","slug":"dont-hack-for-the-prize","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"That shining Dell Venue tablet, the glowing green Razer gaming keyboard.

With Nadella at the helm, this\nstreamtrain of a company has turned itself into near bullet train in a couple of\nmonths. So much so that Endgadget\n[http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/21/when-did-apple-become-the-boring-one/] \nfound it fitting to write, \"When did Apple become the boring one?\"\n\nWhen did Apple become the boring one?\n\nAnyhow, let's dive into some things that Microsoft covered today.\n\nWindows 10\nMicrosoft Edge\nNo, this is not a curved screen Samsung-esque phone. Rather, it's the official\nname for Microsoft's up-and-coming browser (formerly dubbed Project Spartan).\n\n\nImage Courtsey of Betanews\n\nShort of all the super cool annotation features, Cortana appears to be hugely\nuseful in providing contextual data for webpages you visit. Now if only this\ncould be integrated with Apple-like force touch...The new tab page has been\ncompletely revamped to show your news feed and other relevant information\nsimilar to how Google Now operates. If Microsoft manages to execute this right,\nit would be hugely useful to many users out there.\n\nContinuum\nRemember when Apple launched continuity? How they said you could seamlessly\nswitch between devices? With Continuum, you don't need to switch devices anymore\nas it is all one device. Wirelessly connect your future Windows Phone to a\ndisplay, keyboard, and mouse, and bingbadaboom you have a full desktop capable\nof running all the new universal apps. The below video by Microsoft explains it\npretty well.\n\nVisual Studio & Universal Apps\nVS on Linux and OSX\n\n\nImage from BetaNews.\n\n**Holy. Ducking. Git.** (Yay or nay for the euphemism?)Visual Studio Code\n[https://code.visualstudio.com/]  (free) is now available on Linux and OSX, and\nman is it awesome. Featuring native Git integration, you can now compile and run\nC# on basically every platform. Well, almost every platform. Nobody uses Solaris\nright? I've personally taken it for a test run in Ubuntu 14.04, and damn. It\nappears to be based off of Node.JS and Web technologies like Atom and Brackets,\nbut it sure doesn't feel like it. This is the snappiest html based editor I've\never used. Period.\n\nI think this is more than just a beefed-up cross platform IDE from Microsoft.\nWith .NET going cross platform, Microsoft is on the verge of killing Java by\nintroducing the same cross-platform interoperability with many, many times the\nperformance.\n\niOS, Android, and Web integration.\nAll your base are belong to us.\n\nI'm gonna cut to the chase. Put simply, Microsoft has made available SDK's to\neasily convert iOS and Android apps into Windows apps with little to no code\nchanges. Microsoft API's have been opened up to replace the API's on iOS and\nAndroid. This is huge. A lack of app selection has plagued the universal apps\necosystem, and this could be the boost that Microsoft was looking for. If the\nproposition of a 5 minute app port is not enough to save them, then nothing\nwill.\n\nIn terms of Web integration, developers can now convert web apps into Windows\napp with very little code and take advantage of native Windows integrations such\nas notifications and in-app purchases.\n\nOne more thing: Win32 Integration!?!\n\nMicrosoft has taken advantage of their Hyper-V virtualization technology to\nbring Win32 apps to the universal app store. Example Case 1: Microsoft has\nworked with Adobe to port Photoshop Elements into an universal app.\n\nHoloLens\nMicrosoft showed off some more HoloLens. If you don't know what HoloLens is,\njust watch the below. It's self explanatory.\n\nConclusion: Gurl u crazy\nI'm not crazy, but Microsoft sure is. It's almost ironic how Microsoft has done\nexactly what Apple said over a decade ago; think different. Endgadget was right,\nApple is the boring one now. With every single announcement, Microsoft is making\neveryone more excited about the future of Windows and the future of tech in\ngeneral.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","created_at":"2015-04-29 22:04:03","created_by":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","updated_at":"2016-12-26 03:34:03","updated_by":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","published_at":"2015-04-30 00:07:54","published_by":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null},{"id":"5a38742c2b00963fe766d27a","uuid":"a997b5d1-5210-40bf-9583-0de6d25cdff3","title":"Homework with a Side of Sleep, Please","slug":"homework-with-a-side-of-sleep-please","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Do you know what the most spoken sentence in school is? \\\"I'm tired.\\\" Do you know what the second most spoken sentence in school is? \\\"I'm _REALLY_ tired.\\\" As students, we seem to be stuck in a never-ending loop of \\\"wake up, feel tired, go to school, feel more tired, go home, do homework, sleep.\\\" At some point, TGIF became TGIFAICSI (Thank god it's Friday and I can sleep in).

So, my friends, here it is - an overview of how the JavaScript build world works. \\n\\n![Master Diagram](https://static.kevinpei.com/2016/12Untitled_Diagram-1482722779021.png)\\n<p class=\\\"caption\\\">Master Build Process Diagram</p>\\n\\nOne of the first mind-blowing things I figured out was that you could `npm install` client-side code (e.g. [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux#installation)). Sure, they get placed in the node\\\\_modules folder, but that's okay. No matter if you're using ES6 or *require*, putting them in node_modules allows you to import them just like how you do in a Node.JS application.\\n\\n### But how do I include these libs on the client side??\\nThat's where tools like Gulp and Webpack come in. At their very core, Gulp and Webpack don't really do much. Their abilities go something along the lines of *\\\"I can find some files in some directory, do something to them, and then spit them back out somewhere else.\\\"* Essentially, a glorified copy-and-paste tool. \\n\\n### In come the Transpilers, Loaders, and Plugins\\nWhen I say \\\"transpilers\\\" and \\\"plugins\\\", I mean things like:\\n\\n - Browserify (Find and include modules in builds) \\n - Babelify (Convert newer standards to current JavaScript) \\n - Uglify (Compress and minify files) \\n\\nThese are the things that make Gulp and Webpack so powerful. In essence, they act like \\\"powerups\\\" that Gulp and Webpack can make use of. For example, you can tell them to *\\\"find .js files, use uglify to compress and minify them, and then spit them out as one file in a build directory\\\"*\\n\\n**The beauty of Browserify**\\n\\nRemember the problem we had earlier of using stuff from node\\\\_modules in the client side? [Browserify](http://browserify.org) solves that by scanning your imports and packaging them into your output file in a smart way. In other words, it looks at your source file, plucks all the required modules from node\\\\_modules and other places, and puts it all together into a single file such that just works. Pretty cool, eh? \\n\\n###Okay, I can compile JS code now. What's AMD, UMD, and CommonJS?\\nThe problem with JavaScript modules at the moment is that there isn't really much of a standard on how to create and deliver them. There's the AMD specification, CommonJS specification, and ES6 specification to name a few. There's a pretty interesting read on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16521471/relation-between-commonjs-amd-and-requirejs) about this. In short, it's basically the war between `import MyModule from 'my-module'` (ES6), `var MyModule = require('my-module')` (CommonJS), and other standards. There's a great writeup on how all this came about on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sungyeol.choi/javascript-module-module-loader-module-bundler-es6-module-confused-yet-6343510e7bde#.9taklvyrl). \\n\\n**Introduce UMD**\\n\\nThe story goes like this: Some dude on the magical interwebs got tired of all this mismatched horsepoop and made the \\\"Universal Module Definition\\\". Another specification you ask?? No, not really. It's just some special code that makes your module compatible with AMD, CommonJS, and other standards all at the same time. \\n\\n**So which one should I use, and how should I use it?**\\n\\nUse whichever one you want that best fits your needs. I personally recommend UMD simply because it reduces a lot of headache if you need your code in another format sometime in the future. \\n\\nTo actually compile into one of these, just set the appropriate setting or install the appropriate plugin within Gulp/Webpack/Whatever you're using. \\n\\n###How does React play into this?\\nIt happens that React components are a GREAT use of JavaScript modules. After all, Components are essentially just special JavaScript modules. You can use Babel to convert JSX into normal JS through [*even more plugins*](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/) (specifically [transform-react-jsx](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-react-jsx/)). GLHF. \\n\\n###TL;DR. I want the meat of it.\\nSorry, this is as simple of an explanation as I can write. I didn't even get into the technical details of using all these things. \\n\\n**But I really, really want a TL;DR**\\n\\nJavaScript is going through its teenage phase of having no idea about what it wants to do.

Their abilities go something along the lines of \"I\ncan find some files in some directory, do something to them, and then spit them\nback out somewhere else.\"  Essentially, a glorified copy-and-paste tool.\n\nIn come the Transpilers, Loaders, and Plugins\nWhen I say \"transpilers\" and \"plugins\", I mean things like:\n\n * Browserify (Find and include modules in builds)\n * Babelify (Convert newer standards to current JavaScript)\n * Uglify (Compress and minify files)\n\nThese are the things that make Gulp and Webpack so powerful. In essence, they\nact like \"powerups\" that Gulp and Webpack can make use of. For example, you can\ntell them to \"find .js files, use uglify to compress and minify them, and then\nspit them out as one file in a build directory\"\n\nThe beauty of Browserify\n\nRemember the problem we had earlier of using stuff from node_modules in the\nclient side? Browserify [http://browserify.org]  solves that by scanning your\nimports and packaging them into your output file in a smart way. In other words,\nit looks at your source file, plucks all the required modules from node_modules\nand other places, and puts it all together into a single file such that just\nworks. Pretty cool, eh?\n\nOkay, I can compile JS code now. What's AMD, UMD, and CommonJS?\nThe problem with JavaScript modules at the moment is that there isn't really\nmuch of a standard on how to create and deliver them. There's the AMD\nspecification, CommonJS specification, and ES6 specification to name a few.\nThere's a pretty interesting read on StackOverflow\n[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16521471/relation-between-commonjs-amd-and-requirejs] \n about this. In short, it's basically the war between import MyModule from\n'my-module'  (ES6), var MyModule = require('my-module')  (CommonJS), and other\nstandards. There's a great writeup on how all this came about on Medium.\n\nIntroduce UMD\n\nThe story goes like this: Some dude on the magical interwebs got tired of all\nthis mismatched horsepoop and made the \"Universal Module Definition\". Another\nspecification you ask?? No, not really. It's just some special code that makes\nyour module compatible with AMD, CommonJS, and other standards all at the same\ntime.\n\nSo which one should I use, and how should I use it?\n\nUse whichever one you want that best fits your needs. I personally recommend UMD\nsimply because it reduces a lot of headache if you need your code in another\nformat sometime in the future.\n\nTo actually compile into one of these, just set the appropriate setting or\ninstall the appropriate plugin within Gulp/Webpack/Whatever you're using.\n\nHow does React play into this?\nIt happens that React components are a GREAT use of JavaScript modules. After\nall, Components are essentially just special JavaScript modules. You can use\nBabel to convert JSX into normal JS through even more plugins\n[https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/]  (specifically transform-react-jsx\n[http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-react-jsx/]). GLHF.\n\nTL;DR. I want the meat of it.\nSorry, this is as simple of an explanation as I can write. I didn't even get\ninto the technical details of using all these things.\n\nBut I really, really want a TL;DR\n\nJavaScript is going through its teenage phase of having no idea about what it\nwants to do. Wrangle with it with all your might, or just go home and cry.\nSorry, wish I had a better answer.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","created_at":"2016-07-23 19:26:16","created_by":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","updated_at":"2016-12-26 03:26:21","updated_by":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","published_at":"2016-07-23 20:50:07","published_by":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null},{"id":"5a38742c2b00963fe766d27d","uuid":"7a0403fe-82b0-4b39-8dd0-dd09cce48c53","title":"A Bittersweet Closing","slug":"a-bittersweet-closing","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"It's over... just.. over. \\n\\nI try to summarize these 4 years, but nothing comes to mind.

And, like a fever, he will eventually die\nout and, ultimately, leave America stronger and more immune to the likes of him.\nIn garnering massive media attention through his polarizing statements, Trump\nhas gained vocal opposition from Democrats, Republicans, and now, apparently, \nthe Communist Party of China\n[http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/03/china-uses-trump-in-anti-democracy-propaganda.html]\n. He has shown Americans the very hypocrisy that got him famous in the first\nplace - he is quite literally his own archenemy. Now, let's just pray that the\nhost kills the fever and not the other way around.","feature_image":"https://static.kevinpei.com/2016/12Untitled_2-1482729475870.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","created_at":"2016-03-14 17:17:33","created_by":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","updated_at":"2016-12-26 05:18:23","updated_by":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","published_at":"2016-03-14 17:17:00","published_by":"5a38742b2b00963fe766d26b","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null},{"id":"5a38742c2b00963fe766d27f","uuid":"e10e9706-300a-46c0-8960-20c5e20a8e82","title":"What to do when you're out of time and options","slug":"what-to-do-when-youre-out-of-time-and-options","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"***Holy sh\\\\*t, it's 10pm and I haven't started on a project that's due tomorrow.*** <br/>\\nHow many times have we all experienced this, how many times have we given ourselves a mental slap in the face?
