How they said you could seamlessly switch between devices? With Continuum, you don't need to switch devices anymore as it is **all one device**. Wirelessly connect your future Windows Phone to a display, keyboard, and mouse, and bingbadaboom you have a full desktop capable of running all the new universal apps.

I've personally taken it for a test run in Ubuntu 14.04, and damn. It appears to be based off of Node.JS and Web technologies like Atom and Brackets, but it sure doesn't feel like it.

Put simply, Microsoft has made available SDK's to easily convert iOS and Android apps into Windows apps with little to no code changes. Microsoft API's have been opened up to replace the API's on iOS and Android. This is huge. A lack of app selection has plagued the universal apps ecosystem, and this could be the boost that Microsoft was looking for.

You've been warned.**\n\nIn Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\", Carraway has a line towards the end where he says \"You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.\" This is of course directed to Gatsby, as Nick finds people like Tom and Daisy \"careless people\" who \"smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back to their money\". Nick does have a point - the \"careless\" couple seemingly get away with murder after framing Gatsby for the act. Even more conveniently, Gatsby gets killed and with him goes their problems. As such, it's easy for us to side with Nick's antipathy for Tom and Daisy (whom I shall now refer to as \"the duo\"). But in retrospect, are the duo really as bad as Nick makes them out to be?

Gatsby is a war hero, an Oxford man, a self-made croesus who lost his one true love by the delivery speed of a letter.

Next thing you know, your laptop keyboard is covered in drool. It took me 3 MLH Hackathons to win my first prize (albeit a sponsor prize), but now that I have it in my hands I realize how ridiculous it is to hack for a prize. \n\n##The Proposition of Value \nFor one, MLH prizes are totally not worth the effort. If PayScale is to be trusted, the average Student developer with no university degree and one year of experience in Rails or Python earns an average of $60,000 dollars in Toronto, Canada. \n\n![Average pay of $60,000 from PayScale](/blog/content/images/2015/11/Capture.JPG)\n\nDo some simple math, and that averages out to about $30/hour. MLH Hackathons are about 36 hours long, so that works out to about $1080 worth of very very hard work. The value of that Dell Venue tablet?

In the event that you are human however, you really don't stand to profit. \n\n##The Time-Worthiness of Hackathons\n\nSo are Hackathons worth your time and effort? My answer? **Hackathons are _most definitely worth it_**.\n\nIf your hackathon experience revolves around getting that prize, you don't get the point of a hackathon. In my 36 hours at PennApps, Hack the North, and Hack Western, I have met many amazing and talented people with insane aspirations. I have also come to learn that Android Studio is the worst, that Ruby doesn't like Windows, and that Python enjoys giving people temper tantrums. If it weren't for MLH Hackathons, I would have never imagined beginning to even touch maching learning algorithms, I would have never learnt about the god that is Firebase, and I would have most definitely never known that I could survive on 1 hour of sleep in 36 hours without Redbull. \n\n[![In The Loop, winner of Hack Western 2's Best Life Hack](/blog/content/images/2015/11/Capture-1.JPG)](http://devpost.com/software/in-the-loop-real-time-news-aggregating-web-app)\n*In The Loop, winner of Hack Western 2's Best Life Hack*\n\n##The Rosy Conclusion \n\nHack for the sake of hacking. We, the community of Hackathon Hackers, stand for so much more than prizes. *Don't get me wrong, if you won a hackathon prize congratulations are in order*. You made something amazing enough to wow the judges, and you most definitely deserve your prize. If you aren't a winner however, you really still are a winner. In 36 hours you had fun (hopefully), you yelled countless profanities at your laptop, but most importantly you got to be part of an amazing community of people. Lots of groups out there *aspire* to change the world, **Hackathon Hackers _have_ changed the world**. We represent the next generation in creative and productive changemakers, and the fact you didn't win that Dell Tablet doesn't change that. \n\n>Don't get me wrong, if you won a hackathon prize congratulations are in order.
