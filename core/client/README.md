<a href="https://travis-ci.org/TryGhost/Ghost-Admin"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/TryGhost/Ghost-Admin.svg?branch=master" alt="Build status" /></a>

This is the home of Ember.js based admin client that ships with [Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost/ghost). For now, refer to that repository for [install and development instructions](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost#quick-start-install).

## Have a bug or issue?

Bugs and issues (even if they only affect the admin client) should be opened on the core [Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost/ghost/issues) repository.
